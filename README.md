JMS Messaging using Apache ActiveMQ

Like any other message broker, ActiveMQ is used as a communication bridge between multiple components that can be hosted on separate servers or can be written in different programming languages.

Apache ActiveMQ brokers are implementations of the Java Messaging Service, or JMS. JMS is a Java specification which allows applications to send data back and forth between one another in an easy and standard way.
